Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.Machine Learning, as the name suggests, provides machines with the ability to learn autonomously based on experiences, observations and analysing patterns within a given data set without explicitly programming.

Intellipaat offers an industry-specific Machine Learning course that mainly focuses on key modules such as Python, Algorithms, Statistics & Probability, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Linear & Logistic regression, etc. Now let me briefly explain what machine learning is and how it is going to work. Machine Learning is a form of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming. However, machine learning is not a simple process.
